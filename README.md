# Project: Create a Token
This Solidity program contains a Token contract that can perform mint and burn transaction. The purpose of this program is to provide a simple concept on how transactions in a token work such as minting and burning.

## Description
This program is made with solidity and contains a simple contract. The contract has 3 variables as the token's details and 2 functions for minting and burning. This program can be used as an example for simple concepts of token transactions.

## Getting Started

### Executing program
The program can be ran in a web-based online IDE called Remix. here is the link https://remix.ethereum.org/.

After you are in the Remix IDE, create a new file and then copy and paste the contents of the createTokenProject.sol file above.

Once you are done, compile the code by going to the Solidity compiler located at the left tab and make sure that the compiler version is the same as the pragma solidity version at the very beginning of the code. Click compile.

You can now deploy the code by going to the deploy and run transaction located below the Solidity compiler button. Click deploy. You will now be able to interact and do mint and burn functions with the Token.
